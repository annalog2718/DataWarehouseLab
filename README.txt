Import the database structure to a Wamp server using runscapemarketdata.sql

On the home page there is a button to load the data from Runescape_Market_Data.txt. Warning this will take around a half hour to finish running.  To not attempt to run it a second time while it is still processing.

Things that I would have liked to add if I had more time:
- I attempted to add a graph but I couldn't get phpgraph to work properly
- Add an ORDER BY sort function
- Add slice functionality with a WHERE statement
